## ffxi-content/monstrosityinstincts
Very incomplete addon that was eventually intended to spit out the info from the monstrosity instincts you had equipped.<br/>
The included instincts.lua file in this folder is the equivalent of windower\res\items.lua, but for monstrosity instincts.<br/>
As far as I'm aware, it doesn't exist anywhere else on the internet - that said, it's ripped straight from the game's data, so it's nothing unique.
