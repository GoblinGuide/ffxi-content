# The Sheol Gaol Guide You Didn't Know You Needed
I asked enough questions on FFXIAH that I got called a stupid idiot. Which is impressive, given how many people on the internet don't get called stupid idiots.

## Unlocking Sheol Gaol
1) Wait 45 days from character creation.
2) Complete the RoE objective Content → Odyssey → Sheol A:<br/>
    -Talk to the ??? shiny spot next to the big purple crystal in Rabao near Home Point #2.<br/>
    -Receive a "Moglophone" from the Pilgrim Moogle.<br/>
    -Interact with the Veridical Conflux and enter Sheol A.<br/>
    -Progress through the area by using Veridical Confluxes until you reach floor 7.<br/>
    -Interact with the Otherworldly Conflux <b>WITH THE ROE OBJECTIVE SET</b>. (Again, that's Quests → Records of Eminence → Content → Odyssey → "Sheol A"!)<br/>
    -There are Translocators you can interact with on the way. You can teleport between them like Home Points, so hit them.<br/>
    -Watch out for the invisible beastmen near Agon Halos. They have true sight aggro, can't be targeted until the Halo is dead, and prevent you from taking a Conflux to the next floor once aggroed like any other mob.<br/>
4) Wait 20 IRL hours, then get another Moglophone. Then complete the RoE objective Content → Odyssey → Sheol B in the same way.
5) Wait 20 IRL hours, then get another Moglophone. Then complete the RoE objective Content → Odyssey → Sheol C in the same way.
6) Talk to the Pilgrim Moogle again to receive three free "Moglophone II"s.<br/>
Now you can enter Sheol Gaol any time that you have three Moglophone IIs. Every boss fight consumes one, so you will have to restock after every set of fights to get back in.

## Unlocking Gear From Sheol Gaol
Each boss in Sheol Gaol rewards a key item the first time you kill it.<br/>
This key item lets you spend gil at the Pilgrim Moogle in a normal shop menu to purchase all the gear associated with that enemy.<br/>
For example, if you want Nyame armor, you kill Bumba to receive "Information on Bumba", then talk to the Pilgrim Moogle and select "Tier Four", then purchase your Nyame armor.

## Unlocking Augments on Gear From Sheol Gaol
The level of augment available on each piece of gear is determined by the "Vengeance Level" of the associated boss that you've cleared.<br/>
Clearing the boss on V0 ("Vengeance 0"), the starting level of difficulty, lets you augment the item to Rank 15. ("R15")<br/>
Clearing the boss on V15 lets you augment to R20.<br/>
Clearing the boss on V20 lets you augment to R25.<br/>
Clearing the boss on V25 lets you augment to R30.<br/>
You can pay mercenaries to do this for you, or try to get a group together. (Just pay the mercenaries.)

## Leveling Up Augments on Gear From Sheol Gaol
You purchase augments with "Reinforcement Points". These are earned by dealing damage to a boss at any Vengeance level.<br/>
I say "dealing damage to" because both of the mathematically optimal methods do not involve winning the fight. One doesn't even involve actually fighting:<br/>
1) Purchase a Moogle Amplifier from the Pilgrim Moogle for 1,500 segments.<br/>
2) Someone who has cleared Bumba V20 takes you into Bumba V25. (They're likely shouting something like "Bumba 2386 RP 2.5m".)<br/>
3) Use the Moogle Amplifier.<br/>
4) The person selling the entry is on BST. They summon Generous Arthur and have it land Purulent Ooze on Bumba to reduce its max HP by 10%, which counts as dealing 10% damage to it.<br/>
5) Wait 15 minutes for the fight to time out and receive 2,386 RP. (Moogle Amplifiers don't multiply rewards by 3, but add 200% of the base clear reward instead.)

This yields 2,386 RP for 4,500 segments, or 0.53 RP per segment.

Do not be tricked by discussion of "Supercharge" strats - it returns less RP on the targeted Supercharge fight in return for slightly more elsewhere and requiring multiple human beings. Just merc it.

## Becoming Able To Do It All Yourself
### this is a really long process so you can stop reading here if you want and just pay mercs
Some definitions:<br/>
1) "clear" means "be in a party that kills a boss". A party of six all "clear" a fight when that fight gets won.<br/>
2) "enter" means "be the person who selects the boss when interacting with the Conflux inside Sheol Gaol". Only the leader "enters" the fight.<br/>

Vengeance levels are locked by clears on previous Vengeance levels and Tiers:<br/>
1) You can't fight a Tier X boss at any Vengeance level above 0 until you have cleared all four Tier X bsses.<br/>
2) If you clear every Tier X boss at Vengeance N, you can enter the Tier X bosses at Vengeance N+5.<br/>
3) If you clear every Tier X boss at Vengeance N, you can enter the Tier X+1 bosses at Vengeance N.<br/>
(Example: Clearing all the Tier 1 bosses at V15 lets you enter both Tier 1 V20 and Tier 2 V15.)

If nobody in the entire world had ever done Sheol Gaol before, the minimum necessary path for one person to be able to enter everything would be:<br/>
1) Tier 1 clears at V0 → Tier 2 clears at V0 → Tier 3 clears at V0 → Tier 4 clear at V0<br/>
2) Tier 1 clears at V15 → Tier 2 clears at V15 → Tier 3 clears at V15 → Tier 4 clear at V15<br/>
3) Tier 1 clears at V20 → Tier 2 clears at V20 → Tier 3 clears at V20 → Tier 4 clear at V20<br/>
4) Tier 1 clears at V25 → Tier 2 clears at V25 → Tier 3 clears at V25<br/>
5) You <i>don't</i> need a Tier 4 clear at V25 to unlock more fights! You can already enter Bumba V25 because you have a Bumba V20 clear and all Tier 3 V25 cleared. (You do, however, need it to augment Nyame at R30 rather than R25.)

However! There are plenty of people who have <b>already cleared</b> this content. People named mercenaries! They are our friends.

The only two rules that matter are rules 1 and 2 above.<br/>
Purchasing a V15 clear of everything will let you enter V20 Tier 1 and V15 everything else, even if you never entered V0. (to confirm: I actually don't know if you need V0 clears as well?!)<br/>
Purchasing a V25 clear of Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, and a V20 Tier 4, in any order, will let you enter literally everything. That's 17 clears total, and expensive in terms of gil, but that's the minimum Moglophone/segment expenditure.
