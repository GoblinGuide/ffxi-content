# the scraps
<br/><br/>
These are functions and/or files just slammed hapharzardly into this folder that I don't have a use for.<br/>
Whether they're unfinished projects (likely), code stolen from elsewhere (even more likely), or just notes to myself (unlikely, I use comments in luas for that), you get the drift.
