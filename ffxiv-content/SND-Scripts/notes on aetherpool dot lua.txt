aetherpool grip farming notes:
Treasure Coffer is named Treasure Coffer, can we tell them apart by model? if not it's fine because pomander
have to handle "you just got a duplicate pomander" because otherwise the coffer does not go away (store coffer coordinates and add to a list of coffers to ignore after opening them, it's fine)
rotationsolver can handle most everything
	possibly not the floor 10 boss depending on aetherpool level but if you use mch, keep it at 25 yalms, which you can do with snd telling visland/vnavmesh to move you away from it
	that way you can cash in your aetherpools

functions I want:
path to next room, preferring a clockwise rotation so that we use the left hand rule
clear room (should... honestly, not be relevant. if we clear every room we can just run a full loop again, or alternate between "room we came from" and "exit room" until enough mobs have spawned)
open coffer (silver)
	open coffer (all) (this is much more likely than the above)
use pomanders (on floor 10 before boss, or instantly either is fine whatever)
get pylon position

functional loop:
enter potd
walk through every room in floor 1 looking for any coffer and opening it
	assumption: walking process will aggro mobs. kill them via rotation solver and don't move while in combat
go to the pylon, which I assume we can get somehow
repeat for floors 2-9
get to boss, use all pomanders as needed, attack it, use visland to stay 25 yalms from it in a mostly-random direction (get coordinates of center of room and keep a ninety degree angle relative to it at all times?!)
after clear, check aetherpool levels
(can do bonus bronze sack pickups once I get everything else working, that's just using an intuition if the toastnodetext has intuition in it and then using pomander's functionality as well)

relevant potd text is
GetToastNodeText(2, 3) == "The Cairn of Passage is activated!"

opening a coffer and getting a pomander will take that text away

yield("/echo " .. GetObjectRawXPos("Cairn of Passage"))
yield("/echo " .. GetObjectRawYPos("Cairn of Passage"))
yield("/echo " .. GetObjectRawZPos("Cairn of Passage"))
works when it's in range, except it might not be named that in potd obviously


size of a potd room:
one corner 300, 0, -258.5, opposite is 300, -8, -225
316, 0, -241 to 283, 0, -242

assume we spawn in the center? it looks like we do

middle of one room
-366 0 300

middle of next room over
-419 0 300

prediction: somewhere around -316
actually more like 300 aw fuck geometry

boss positioning notes:
player spawn on floor 10:
-300 0 -200 (approx)

middle on floor 10:
-300 0 -220

so the four corners will be
-300 -200 (south)
-300 -240 (north)
-320 -220 (this is west I think)
-280 -220 (which makes this east but I should test)
