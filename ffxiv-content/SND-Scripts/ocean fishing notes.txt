big ol' optimal fishing list:
GENERAL: hook everything outside spectral, don't fuck around with intuitions except where noted
ALL ZONES, VERY START OF Z1: patience 2 to build AA stacks (probably just once? haven't considered whether a second use is optimal) then hi-cordial and let's go


1) jellyfish route (galadion day, southern merlthor sunset, rhotano night)
first mission: 5 sharks
1-1) galadion day
before spectral:
	mission 3 !!!, ragworm [more Tarnished Sharks from Ragworm without much impact on spectral bite chance]
	weather = showers, plump worm [Tarnished Shark cannot bite.]
	else krill
	
during spectral:
	ragworm
	DH-IC-PC-TH Nimble Dancer (! 12+) if at least 3 AA stacks to have the GP for it [otherwise just blind TH]
	if no Nimble Dancers after 1m has elapsed (aka halfway through aka you have GP), also DH Casket Oyster (! 7-11) and Merman's Mane (!! 2-3)
	[perhaps I want to care about sharks, in which case also DH Ghost Shark (!! 3-4) we will return to check this later]
	late in current: TH over DH if have GP, or IC a Nimble Dancer if one somehow ends late
	
after spectral: mission bait
	!!! -> plump [sharks can bite regardless of earlier weather, it's clear now]
	!! -> krill
	! -> krill

1-2) southern merlthor sunset

before spectral:
	ragworm

during spectral:

	!!! -> krill for crabs, can't catch anything but the intuition fish here
	! -> ragworm
