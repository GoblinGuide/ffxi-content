/maincommand Trust will open the trust menu (once that's enabled, can add that the same way I added tweaks enable baitcommand in Umbral)

--when you're in UI debug, go Focused Units -> Dawn to find these

Dawn is the name of the pcall for basically everything in this menu

pcall Dawn 15 0 selects Holminster Switch
1 Dohn Mheg 2 Qitana Ravel 3 Malikah's Well 4 Mount Gulg 5 Amaurot

pcall Dawn 20 0 switches to Shadowbringers
pcall Dawn 20 1 switches to Endwalker



node with all the trusts in it is [#89] Res Node ptr = 1FF8DBEAFF0
then nodes 98-101 have child node that has child node that has child node that has child node of type Counter 

--first trust in your party's level. gonna have to instead cache them all at the start and check incoming chat log I think because you can only get the ones in your party's level I *think*?
nodeone = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1) --this is the entire trust window
nodetwo = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89) --the sidebar on the left under Current Party
nodethree = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99) --99, 100, and 101 are the first, second, and third trusts (98 is you if this somehow comes up)
nodefour = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99, 8) --this is the entire box with the person's face and info, it's a subnode of the above node despite being visually the same
nodefive = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99, 8, 11) --this is the node with the info (it's not 27, which is also a res node, that one holds the images and such)
nodesix = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99, 8, 11, 12) --box on the left that has level in it, res node so it holds info
nodeseven = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99, 8, 11, 12, 13) --visually identical to previous box. What the hell is type 1028, That's not even a power of 2!
FirstPartyTrustLevel = GetNodeText("Dawn", 1, 89, 99, 8, 11, 12, 13, 2) --this is a node of type Counter so we can't use getnodetext here? asking croizat to add a function for this

--the entire party information, can we pull it all at once? don't think it's loaded when unselected but we'll see
--FOR ENDWALKER:
--node 64 is the right box with the party showing
--72-77 are the nongraha trusts left to right, then 71 is graha on the far right

--FOR SHADOWBRINGERS:
--node 49 is the right box with the party
--dunno trust numbers

--FOR BOTH:
--node 86 is the base component node with information on the selected trust member on the right
--3 is the res node that holds everything
--14 holds 15 holds 2 holds the trust's level
--9 holds 12 holds current xp and 13 holds total exp to next level
--THESE are text nodes, can we make this work?


--getnodetext will return the last index you passed in if it fails, so if you see "2" instead of what you're supposed to get, that's why
