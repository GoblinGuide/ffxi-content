#ffxi-content/pricelogger
A quick and dirty little addon that I whipped up (read: borrowed someone else's code) to log the price [objective, i.e. measured in net gil received] of literally everything you sell. <br />
This output file can get BIG because there's no duplicate removal. That'll come before v1.0 Someday(tm).
