Okay, here's the deal. Sparky is OLD. There are copies of it publicly visible on Google dating back to 2017. So I'm not gonna feel too bad about this if you stumble across it somehow.<br/>
Sparky automatically sells items that hit your inventory. Think of treasury. But it will do it literally any time. No NPC in the entire zone needed, let alone a store NPC. And it sells for more than max fame price, somehow.<br/>
The magic command is "sparky purge". Put item IDs on the list here to sell them.
