BuzzOff.lua<br />

A fork of fuckoff.lua that added a toggle button (bees annoy you when they buzz, so you want to be able to stop them. It makes sense, I swear.)<br/ >
Intended goal: add an alias to windower\scripts\init.txt with a line like "bind ^q buzzoff toggle" and have ctrl-q toggle filtering for the filter list<br/ >
Toggling filtering does *not* filter out the blocklist. That's for those those RMT shouts with the stars.
