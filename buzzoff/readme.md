# ffxi-addons/buzzoff

A fork of fuckoff.lua that added toggle filtering<br/ >
Add an alias to windower\scripts\init.txt like "bind ^q buzzoff toggle" to have ctrl-q toggle filtering for the filter list<br/ >
Toggling filtering does *not* filter out the blocklist. RMT shouts with the stars will be gone no matter what.
